An agent based model that aims to support or oppose the hypothesis that living in smaller hives, and swarming frequently aids bee survival in the wild when colonies are infected with Varroa mites. This project has been undertaken by Team Wintermute, Teesside University. 

To run this model, open wintermute-bee-model.nlogoin NetLogo (Tested on 5.3.1), and configure the parameters as you see fit. The parameters are by default set to aid the stabalization of the bee's. Be aware that some parameters have massive influence on the population; however the default parameters are set to stablize.
